#Single-Cycle-ALU-Quartus

This is some of the work done for the CSC 343 Computer Organization class, the work was done to create a Single Cycle ALU  based on the MIPS instruction architecture.
I lost a lot of the files from the latter half of the project where all of the components were put together.
This project was done on Quartus Alter II software in collaboration with MutiSim and DE2 FPGA Board Serial: EP2C35F672C6

There are videos explanation of Project 1 and 3 here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XPolftawIF9r2jLfQgctUf3mataII8C
