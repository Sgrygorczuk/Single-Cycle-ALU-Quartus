#Single-Cycle-ALU-Quartus

This is some of the work done for the CSC 343 Computer Organization class, the work was done to create a Single Cycle ALU  based on the MIPS instruction architecture.
I lost the videos and reports for the last two parts of the project, I've included Readme.txt in them to give a general idea of what they
were intended for, a bit of it may be confusing as they project due dates stacked and many of the parts were done back to back between two
tests of similar caliber of work. 
This project was done on Quartus Alter II software in collaboration with MutiSim and DE2 FPGA Board Serial: EP2C35F672C6

There are videos explanation of Project 1 and 3 here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XPolftawIF9r2jLfQgctUf3mataII8C
