This was the final part of the project where all the components came together to create a CPU, the ALU was modified to be able to 
use the Bitwise function, a memory, cpu memory and pc were added, an optcode controller was made to deal with the instructions 
and it was all supposed to display on the FPGA board. Architecturally I think it was mostly sound but this being done in roughly a 
span of three or four days I wasn't able to make it work correctly, as I recall the timing was wrong and the different parts of  
instruction got executed wrong or would just stall the whole system. This was most likely due to the fact that all the 
base components were my creations so there probably was a small thing that stacked together to break the whole system. 
It was a good attempt at a CPU but it doesn't work.
